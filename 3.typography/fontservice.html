                <h1>Don't stray too far from your laptop at Starbucks</h1>
                <p>
                    All across New York, Starbucks pops up again and again on police blotters because of purses, bags, laptops and other items stolen after being abandoned by customers picking up their drinks or using the bathroom. "Officers have set up stings in the chainâ€™s stores," says this New York Times story.</p>
                    <p>"A commander even asked one branch to put up a sign warning customers; the manager demurred, saying such a sign required corporate approval." MY TAKE FROM THE CHICAGO AREA: Starbucks customers here are pretty careful, and generally ask another customer to keep an eye on their belongs while they step away from their tables.

                        In my city, we have a Starbucks literally right across from a Peet's, and in another part, we have a Seattle's Best on the same block as another Starbucks.

                        Seattle's Best has more drink seleciton, and is a bit more expensive than starbucks with the simillar drinks that they have. Starbucks, is Starbucks many people go there and buy drink, i bet its one of the most famouse coffe shops in the world.

                        Gotta love the name of that police officer! Anyway, it sounds like this is only identified as a Starbucks problem because there are more Starbucks in NYC than any other similar business, so it naturally happens more often at Starbucks.
